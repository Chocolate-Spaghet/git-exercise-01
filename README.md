# Git Exercise 1

This is a short exercise that will help you to understand the typical
workflow when using git. In this case the remote repository that you will 
be cloning is a GitHub repository, but the workflow is the same whether it
is on GitHub or another server.

## A Repository that Introduces the Git Workflow

**Tasks**

- Fork this repository (in GitHub)

- Clone your fork of the repository to your local machine.

- Add an `upstream` remote to this repository using the `git remote add ...` command

- Add a new file in the `developers/` directory. The filename should be named
`YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.md` where you must replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` by your actual GitHub username.

- Track the file using the `git add` command

- Commit your changes using the `git commit` command

- Push your changes to your fork (the `origin` remote) on GitHub

- Open a Pull Request to `hunter-college-cs-ossd/Git-Exercise-01` with your additions

- Ask the mentor to review your PR - the exercise is complete once your changes have been merged.
